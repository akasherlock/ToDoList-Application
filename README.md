#To-do list application

## Introduction

- My to-do list application keeps track of things to do and crosses things off when they are done.
- This application can be used by anyone who likes to plan their to-do work accordingly. Example: Students tracking their assignments
- As a student myself, it's not easy to keep track of due assignments, deadlines, etc. One can easily forget about their work due to a heavy workload. 
- This application is designed to help students like myself so that they can efficiently keep track of their to-do work. It is also usable generally and can be used for keeping track of to-do items.

## Phase 4: Task 3

Refactoring I would have done if had more time:

- Apply the composite pattern to the classes so that adding any other functionality or changing behaviour is a bit easier to do.
- Adding a bunch of exceptions so that the classes are more Robust.
- Extracting methods to capture the behaviour of parts of the method that are difficult to read and understand.
- Try to eliminate any duplicate code by introducing new understandable methods.
- Replace Gui class with more classes such that all classes are doing a single work. Example: Different classes for setting panels, textAreas, etc.
